# Assignment-3

This project deals with the implementation of a ring queue and its iterators. The ring queue is built to hold a specified number of 
items and can never be filled. When an element is added that goes beyond this maximum size, it replaces the first item in the array.
The goal of this project was to better understand iterators and learning how to build our own, as well as exposing us to new container
types and learning how to implement them.

###Further Notes
I am aware that currently the RingQueue::end() function only works for RingQueues that are not completely full. I plan on working through
this issue in the coming week, but wanted to have something to submit for the assignment's due date as posted on CCLE. Given that Professor
Salazar will not be personally grading the assignments until after Finals Week, I hope that this is acceptable.
